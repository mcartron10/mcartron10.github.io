# Project 2 Reflection

For Project 2, we created custom functions with many end points (parameters) to query the recipes of the Spoonacular API, as well as create a function to parse the retrieved data into a usable and reproducible format. From there we illustrated this functionality with some basic data exploration via numerical summaries, contingency tables, and visualizations. In our exploration, we did not find anything interesting per se, but rather were quite satisfied with the flexibility of our functions; they could certainly be used to explore the recipe data with greater depth and be the foundation for some statistical models. 

The most difficult part of this assignment was contacting the Spoonacular API. The documentation on the Spoonacular website was clear and relatively straightforward, but due to my lack of experience with APIs this was certainly the area into which I had to put most of my energy. With some practice, it became easier with time. I also improved my knowledge of functions as the functions we developed were more involved than most of those that I have created in the past. 

One other point of difficulty was the Spoonacular API version we used. Unfortunately, the free version is quite limited, and will prevent the user from making more than 3 endpoint calls **per day**. This was a recurring annoyance and made some of the process rather frustrating. 

In the future, I would probably create a sort of testing document for code that does not involve querying the API so that I could test certain bugs without using up more of my daily API call allotment. I wouldâ€”for any future vignette--also like to research more features within RMarkdown to make the final vignette even more dynamic!

This project was an excellent introduction to APIs and I felt I gained plenty of new knowledge and skills.
