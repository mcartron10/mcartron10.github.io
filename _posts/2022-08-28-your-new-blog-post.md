## Data Science and Statistics

### Prompt: What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

There is no shortage of articles, videos, and other resources attempting to pin down a precise definition for the field of data science. Some articles emphasize its 
proximity to statistics, others computer science, and there are still others that suggest it deserves to be thought of as a sort of corollary of several fields, and should 
stand on its own. Over time, research in various fields has yielded subfields that today are not perceived at such. Chemistry is a standalone field, but it would 
certainly be possible to argue that chemistry is a kind of highly specialized physics, even if we tend to not think of it that way. 

I am not entirely certain where I stand here. Data science exists somewhere in the space between computer science (think programming and computing), statistics, and 
specialized knowledge regarding a particular industry and software production pipeline. Data science is all about harnessing predictive modeling to make business decisions
and improve a product or service. It requires knowledge of various modeling techniques (whether statistical or more computational)--their scope and how to interpret them--
as well as the programming skills to implement them. It also requires the analytical (and domain-specific) skills to recognize useable data and process it.

While there are much better explanations regarding exactly what data science is, I think the distinction between data science and statistics is somewhat clear. Statistics,
at least in my academic training, has been less about predicting specific outcomes and more about establishing relationships (or lack thereof) between variables. With 
this in mind, it is especially clear why, in the health sector, job listings in the domain of statistics and programming call for "statisticians" and "statistical programmers"
more than "data scientists" and other closely related job titles (AI scientist, applied scientist, machine learning scientist, etc.). I would imagine that in medical 
research, researchers are more interested in using statistical models to establish relationships (drug A reduces severity of x) than anything else. But in insurance, a 
machine learning model that tells an auto insurance company the number of claims they expect to receive given the amount of traffic in a given city (a random example 
here) and can be integrated in real time will be more useful than using a model that establishes a link between automobile accidents and traffic.

I do not have that much experience in industry when it comes to data science, and my background is mostly in statistics and statistical research. My examples and 
thoughts will, I am sure, reflect this, and I know that I cannot better articulate the nuance of the differences between statistics, data science, computer science, etc.,
without gaining a better understanding of each. I am looking forward to furthering my statistical education, but am also eager to learn more about data science and 
improve my programming skills.
