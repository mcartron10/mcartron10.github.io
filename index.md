# About
Hi everyone, my name is Matthieu Cartron and in this blog I will be discussing the following:
- Statistics, from ideas/concepts to various models
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- Miscellaneous topics in the realm of the above

I'll include a photo of myself at some point, but for now I'll include this, which may or may not engender distaste (or admiration) if you follow English soccer.
