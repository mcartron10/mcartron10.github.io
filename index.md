# About
Hi everyone, my name is Matthieu Cartron and in this blog I will be discussing the following:
- Statistics, from ideas/concepts to various models
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- Miscellaneous topics in the realm of the above

I'll include a photo of myself at some point, but for now I'll include this, which may or may not engender distaste (or admiration) if you follow English soccer.

Okay, so maybe a little over the top. Let's try with html to reduce the image size.

Given Liverpool's rather poor start to the [2022-2023 Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) season, I think it makes sense to keep it a little smaller for now. What do you think? I will leave both up (I will try to stop talking about it--haha). 

A little more about me: I am a French-American student at NCSU and am in my first year of the Master of Statistics program, which I'm pursuing via distance education. I currently live in Albuquerque, New Mexico with my wife, and work for the [New Mexico Workers' Compensation Administration](https://workerscomp.nm.gov/).
